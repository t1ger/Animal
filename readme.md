Homework for week4: Data Driven Website

Detailed instructions:

For this assessment you should create a data driven website that uses html, css, JavaScript and templates to display some data. This data will be some creative commons material taken from wikipedia about different animals.

You can find a zip file link below that contains everything you need to start.
Assignment.zip

the zip file contains the following:

the JavaScript and css libraries you might need (jquery, bootstrap, handlebars)
empty JavaScript and CSS files to put your code in
a HTML file with a head that imports the libraries, JavaScript and css files and an empty body to put your HTML code in
a JavaScript file called AnimalsData.js which creates a complex data structure that you will be displaying
AnimalsData.js contains a single variable called ¡°animals_data¡±. This variable is an object that contains an array called ¡°category¡±. Each element in the array represents a class of animals (reptiles, mammals, birds) and it contains a name and another array called ¡°animals¡± which contains objects representing species of animal. Each object has the following member variables:

name; the name of the species

description: a textual description of the species

image1: an image of an example of the species

image2: a second, alternative, image

You should create the following:

A HTML file containing the structures of your page, including templates designed to display the data
A JavaScript file that maps the data onto the templates and provides any interactivity
A CSS file that styles the web site (you may optionally use bootstrap).
